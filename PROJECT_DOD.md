# Project DoD: Muffin Pan Recipes — First E2E Recipe

## Outcomes (What "shipped" looks like)
- [ ] One complete recipe exists that was generated by Baker (Margaret), written up by Copywriter (Marcus), and approved by Creative Director (Steph)
- [ ] The recipe has an AI-generated hero image produced by Art Director (Julian) via Stability AI / RunPod
- [ ] Erik received a Discord notification that a recipe was ready for review
- [ ] Erik approved the recipe through the admin dashboard
- [ ] The approved recipe was published as static HTML on muffinpanrecipes.com via Vercel auto-deploy
- [ ] Each agent consulted its persistent memory file before performing its task
- [ ] The Screenwriter (if active) captured at least one creative tension moment from the pipeline run

## Constraints (What must always be true)
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys or secrets in code — all credentials via .env
- [ ] No hardcoded absolute paths — relative paths or PROJECT_ROOT only
- [ ] Recipe JSON is persisted to data/recipes/ immediately upon creation (never exists only in memory)
- [ ] Creative Director can reject a recipe (triggers revision loop, max 3 cycles)
- [ ] Human rejection archives the recipe with notes — does not delete it
- [ ] Published recipe page loads in < 3 seconds on mobile
- [ ] Each agent uses the model assigned in the PRD (Ollama for Baker, Claude for Copywriter, etc.) — not all the same model
- [ ] Pipeline failures send Discord notifications — they don't fail silently
- [ ] Recipe moves through correct state lifecycle: pending → approved → published (or → rejected)

## Non-Goals (Explicitly out of scope for this milestone)
- Social media distribution (Pinterest, Instagram, TikTok)
- Writers Room season planning and character arcs
- Meta-learning sessions
- Newsletter / email signup functionality
- User-generated content
- Video content
- Multiple recipes or batch generation

## Evidence Required (What proves it)
- [ ] EVIDENCE.md shows all scenarios green (or SKIP with documented reason)
- [ ] The published recipe is accessible at its public URL on muffinpanrecipes.com
- [ ] Recipe JSON exists in data/recipes/published/ with all required fields populated
- [ ] Agent memory files show evidence of being read and written during the pipeline run
- [ ] Discord notification history shows the review notification was sent
- [ ] Git log shows the auto-deploy commit from the publishing pipeline

## Repeatability (How to re-run the proof)
- Trigger a new recipe generation via admin dashboard or CLI
- Observe the recipe moving through each pipeline stage
- Verify Discord notification arrives
- Approve via admin dashboard
- Confirm published URL is live
