# Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese Bites

[Jump to Recipe](#recipe-card)

## Why Muffin Pans?
Mac and cheese is usually a side dish, but the mini muffin pan turns it into a finger food. The high heat of the small cups creates a crispy cheese "crust" on the outside while keeping the center creamy.

## Ingredients
### The Base
- 225g (8 oz) Elbow macaroni, cooked al dente
- 200g (2 cups) Shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 150g (1 cup) Cooked chicken, shredded
- 60ml (1/4 cup) Buffalo wing sauce
- 60ml (1/4 cup) Ranch or Blue cheese dressing
- 1 large Egg, beaten

### The Topping
- 30g (1/4 cup) Panko breadcrumbs
- 15g (1 tbsp) Melted butter

## Instructions
1. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 24-cup mini muffin pan thoroughly.
2. **Mix:** In a large bowl, combine cooked macaroni, cheese, shredded chicken, buffalo sauce, dressing, and the beaten egg. Stir until every noodle is coated.
3. **Scoop:** Pack the mixture firmly into the mini muffin cups, slightly mounding the tops.
4. **Top:** Combine panko and melted butter; sprinkle a small amount over each cup.
5. **Bake:** Bake for 15-18 minutes until the tops are golden and the edges are crispy.
6. **Set:** This is critical: let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes. This allows the cheese to set so the bites hold their shape.

## Muffin-Specific Pro Tips
- **The Egg Binder:** Don't skip the egg. While the cheese melts, the egg provides the structural "glue" that allows these to be picked up like a cracker without falling apart.
- **Panko Crunch:** For extra crunch, toast the panko in a pan with the butter for 1 minute before topping the bites.
