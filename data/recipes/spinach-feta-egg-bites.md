# Spinach and Feta Egg Bites

[Jump to Recipe](#recipe-card)

## Why Muffin Pans?
The muffin pan is the ultimate tool for "egg bites" because it provides consistent heat distribution for individual portions. By using a muffin tin, you create a high surface area that allows the eggs to set quickly while remaining tender, making them perfect for meal prep and grab-and-go breakfasts.

## Ingredients
### For the Egg Mixture
- 6 large Eggs
- 60ml (1/4 cup) Heavy cream or whole milk
- 2g (1/4 tsp) Salt
- 1g (1/4 tsp) Black pepper

### For the Filling
- 100g (2 cups) Fresh baby spinach, finely chopped
- 75g (1/2 cup) Feta cheese, crumbled
- 30g (1/4 cup) Green onions, thinly sliced

## Instructions
1. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Generously grease a 12-cup standard muffin pan with non-stick spray or butter.
2. **Whisk:** In a large bowl or blender, whisk together eggs, cream, salt, and pepper until completely smooth and slightly frothy.
3. **Layer:** Distribute the chopped spinach, crumbled feta, and green onions evenly across the 12 muffin cups.
4. **Pour:** Pour the egg mixture over the fillings, filling each cup about 3/4 full.
5. **Bake:** Bake for 20-22 minutes, or until the centers are set and the tops are slightly golden.
6. **Cool:** Let the bites rest in the pan for 5 minutes before using a thin spatula or knife to gently release them.

## Muffin-Specific Pro Tips
- **The Steam Secret:** Place a small pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven while baking to create a moist environment, resulting in a more velvety, sous-vide-like texture.
- **Don't Overfill:** Eggs puff up significantly during baking; filling more than 3/4 full will cause "mushroom tops" that stick to the pan surface.
