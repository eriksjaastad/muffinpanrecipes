# Classic Blueberry Muffin Tops

[Jump to Recipe](#recipe-card)

## Why Muffin Pans?
The muffin pan is the namesake for a reason. It provides the vertical support needed for the batter to rise into that iconic domed shape while the metal walls create a delicate, golden-brown crust that contrasts with the soft crumb.

## Ingredients
### Dry Ingredients
- 250g (2 cups) All-purpose flour
- 10g (2 tsp) Baking powder
- 2g (1/4 tsp) Salt
- 150g (3/4 cup) Granulated sugar

### Wet Ingredients
- 120ml (1/2 cup) Vegetable oil or melted butter
- 1 large Egg
- 120ml (1/2 cup) Milk
- 5ml (1 tsp) Vanilla extract
- 2g (1/2 tsp) Lemon zest

### The Berries
- 150g (1 cup) Fresh or frozen blueberries

## Instructions
1. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a 12-cup standard muffin pan with paper liners.
2. **Mix Dry:** Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.
3. **Mix Wet:** In another bowl, whisk oil, egg, milk, vanilla, and lemon zest.
4. **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir until just moistened (lumps are okay). Gently fold in the blueberries.
5. **Fill:** Divide the batter evenly among the 12 cups.
6. **Bake:** Bake for 18-22 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.

## Muffin-Specific Pro Tips
- **The "High Heat" Trick:** Start the oven at 425°F for the first 5 minutes, then drop to 375°F. This initial burst of heat activates the baking powder faster, creating a taller, more professional muffin dome.
- **Toss the Berries:** Toss your blueberries in a teaspoon of flour before adding them to the batter. This prevents them from sinking to the bottom of the muffin cup.
