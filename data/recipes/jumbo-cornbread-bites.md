# Jumbo Cornbread Honey Bites

[Jump to Recipe](#recipe-card)

## Why Muffin Pans?
Using a jumbo muffin pan allows for a "crust-to-crumb" ratio that you can't get with a standard loaf. The larger volume allows the center to stay incredibly moist while the high heat of the pan creates a sweet, crispy bottom.

## Ingredients
### Dry Ingredients
- 150g (1 1/4 cups) Yellow cornmeal
- 125g (1 cup) All-purpose flour
- 10g (2 tsp) Baking powder
- 2g (1/4 tsp) Salt

### Wet Ingredients
- 240ml (1 cup) Buttermilk
- 115g (1/2 cup) Butter, melted
- 100g (1/2 cup) Granulated sugar
- 30ml (2 tbsp) Honey
- 1 large Egg

## Instructions
1. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 6-cup jumbo muffin pan thoroughly with butter.
2. **Mix Dry:** Combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt.
3. **Mix Wet:** In a separate bowl, whisk buttermilk, melted butter, sugar, honey, and egg.
4. **Combine:** Pour wet into dry. Stir until just combined; do not overmix or the cornbread will be tough.
5. **Scoop:** Divide the batter evenly among the 6 jumbo cups.
6. **Bake:** Bake for 22-25 minutes until the edges are deep golden and a toothpick comes out clean.

## Muffin-Specific Pro Tips
- **The Butter Sizzle:** For a truly professional crust, put a tiny sliver of butter in each cup and place the pan in the oven for 2 minutes before adding the batter. The batter will "fry" slightly as it hits the hot metal.
- **Honey Glaze:** Brush the tops with a little extra honey and melted butter immediately after taking them out of the oven.
