# Mini Pancake Bites

[Jump to Recipe](#recipe-card)

## Why Muffin Pans?
Flipping pancakes for a crowd is tedious. The mini muffin pan automates the process, creating perfectly round, fluffy bites that are "dippable." This method ensures every pancake is done at the exact same time.

## Ingredients
### The Batter
- 150g (1 1/4 cups) All-purpose flour
- 15g (1 tbsp) Baking powder
- 15g (1 tbsp) Sugar
- 2g (1/4 tsp) Salt
- 240ml (1 cup) Milk
- 1 large Egg
- 30g (2 tbsp) Melted butter or oil

### Toppings (Optional)
- Chocolate chips, blueberries, or sprinkles

## Instructions
1. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 24-cup mini muffin pan very well.
2. **Whisk Batter:** Whisk all ingredients together until mostly smooth. A few small lumps are fine.
3. **Fill:** Fill each mini cup about 2/3 of the way with batter.
4. **Top:** Add a few chocolate chips or berries to each cup if desired.
5. **Bake:** Bake for 12-14 minutes until the pancakes are puffed and spring back when touched.
6. **Serve:** Serve with a side of maple syrup for dipping.

## Muffin-Specific Pro Tips
- **The Dip Strategy:** Since these are round, they are perfect for dipping into a small bowl of syrup rather than pouring it over, which keeps them from getting soggy.
- **Batch Cooking:** These freeze incredibly well. Just pop them in the toaster oven or microwave for 30 seconds to reheat.
