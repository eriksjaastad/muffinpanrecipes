# Baked Oatmeal Breakfast Cups

[Jump to Recipe](#recipe-card)

## Why Muffin Pans?
Individual oatmeal cups solve the problem of "soggy leftovers" common with large-batch baked oatmeal. The muffin pan creates a slightly toasted exterior and a soft, cake-like interior for every serving, making them easy to wrap and take on the road.

## Ingredients
### The Dry Base
- 270g (3 cups) Rolled oats (old-fashioned)
- 5g (1 tsp) Baking powder
- 4g (1 tsp) Ground cinnamon
- 2g (1/4 tsp) Salt

### The Wet Mixture
- 480ml (2 cups) Milk of choice
- 2 large Eggs
- 80ml (1/3 cup) Pure maple syrup
- 60g (1/4 cup) Unsweetened applesauce
- 5ml (1 tsp) Vanilla extract

### Mix-ins
- 100g (3/4 cup) Fresh or frozen blueberries or chocolate chips

## Instructions
1. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 12-cup standard muffin pan with paper liners or grease well.
2. **Mix Dry:** In a large bowl, combine oats, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
3. **Mix Wet:** In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, maple syrup, applesauce, and vanilla.
4. **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until well combined. Fold in your chosen mix-ins.
5. **Scoop:** Divide the mixture evenly among the 12 muffin cups. They will be nearly full; this is expected as they don't rise much.
6. **Bake:** Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the tops feel firm and a toothpick comes out clean.

## Muffin-Specific Pro Tips
- **Soak Time:** Let the filled muffin pan sit for 5-10 minutes before putting it in the oven. This allows the oats to absorb some liquid, leading to a softer, more uniform texture.
- **Freezer Friendly:** These are best stored in the freezer; reheat in the microwave for 45-60 seconds for a "fresh-baked" morning meal.
