# Mini Shepherd's Pie Pots

[Jump to Recipe](#recipe-card)

## Why Muffin Pans?
Shepherd's Pie is notoriously difficult to serve neatly. The muffin pan creates self-contained "pots" that maintain the perfect ratio of meat to potato in every single bite, making them ideal for kids or party appetizers.

## Ingredients
### The Meat Filling
- 450g (1 lb) Ground lamb or beef
- 150g (1 cup) Frozen peas and carrots
- 1 small Onion, finely diced
- 30ml (2 tbsp) Tomato paste
- 120ml (1/2 cup) Beef broth
- 5ml (1 tsp) Dried thyme

### The Potato Topping
- 500g (3 large) Potatoes, peeled and boiled
- 30g (2 tbsp) Butter
- 60ml (1/4 cup) Milk
- 1g (1/4 tsp) Salt

## Instructions
1. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 12-cup standard muffin pan.
2. **Cook Filling:** Brown meat with onion in a skillet. Stir in tomato paste, broth, thyme, and frozen vegetables. Simmer for 5 minutes until thickened.
3. **Mash:** Mash the boiled potatoes with butter, milk, and salt until smooth.
4. **Layer:** Spoon the meat mixture into each muffin cup, filling about 2/3 of the way.
5. **Top:** Scoop or pipe the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Use a fork to create little peaks (they brown beautifully).
6. **Bake:** Bake for 15-20 minutes until the potato peaks are golden brown.

## Muffin-Specific Pro Tips
- **The "Fork Texture":** Dragging a fork across the top of the potatoes isn't just for looks; those thin ridges crisp up in the high heat of the oven, providing a texture contrast to the soft meat.
- **Cooling is Key:** Let them sit for 5 minutes so the gravy in the meat base can thicken slightly before you lift them out.
