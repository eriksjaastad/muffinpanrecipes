# Dark Chocolate Chip Decadence

[Jump to Recipe](#recipe-card)

## Why Muffin Pans?
Muffin pans allow for a "controlled melt." By baking in individual portions, the chocolate chips stay suspended in the cake rather than pooling at the bottom of a large pan. This ensures every bite has the perfect chocolate-to-cake ratio.

## Ingredients
### Dry Ingredients
- 220g (1 3/4 cups) All-purpose flour
- 40g (1/2 cup) Unsweetened cocoa powder
- 150g (3/4 cup) Brown sugar, packed
- 5g (1 tsp) Baking soda
- 2g (1/4 tsp) Salt

### Wet Ingredients
- 180ml (3/4 cup) Sour cream or Greek yogurt
- 80ml (1/3 cup) Vegetable oil
- 2 large Eggs
- 60ml (1/4 cup) Milk
- 5ml (1 tsp) Vanilla extract

### The Chocolate
- 175g (1 cup) Dark chocolate chips (60% cacao or higher)

## Instructions
1. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a 12-cup standard muffin pan with paper liners.
2. **Sift & Mix:** Sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir in the brown sugar.
3. **Whisk Wet:** In a separate bowl, whisk sour cream, oil, eggs, milk, and vanilla until smooth.
4. **Fold:** Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry until just combined. Fold in 3/4 of the chocolate chips.
5. **Scoop:** Fill muffin cups nearly to the top. Sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips on top of each.
6. **Bake:** Bake for 18-20 minutes. A toothpick should come out with a few moist crumbs.

## Muffin-Specific Pro Tips
- **The Sour Cream Secret:** Sour cream adds acidity and fat, which reacts with the baking soda to create an incredibly moist and tender crumb that stays soft for days.
- **Cooling Time:** Let these cool completely before removing the liners. The molten chocolate needs time to set so it doesn't stick to the paper.
