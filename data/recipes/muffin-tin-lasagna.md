# Muffin Tin Lasagna Cups

[Jump to Recipe](#recipe-card)

## Why Muffin Pans?
Traditional lasagna is messy and hard to serve. The muffin pan creates "personal lasagnas" with a high ratio of crispy edges—the best part of the dish—while keeping the layers of cheese and sauce perfectly intact.

## Ingredients
### The Layers
- 24 Wonton wrappers (2 per cup)
- 400g (1.5 cups) Marinara sauce
- 250g (1 cup) Ricotta cheese
- 200g (2 cups) Shredded mozzarella cheese
- 50g (1/2 cup) Grated Parmesan cheese

### The Filling (Optional)
- 200g (1/2 lb) Cooked Italian sausage or ground beef
- 5g (1 tsp) Dried oregano

## Instructions
1. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 12-cup standard muffin pan thoroughly.
2. **Base Layer:** Press one wonton wrapper into the bottom of each muffin cup, ensuring it covers the bottom and sides.
3. **First Layer:** Add a small dollop of ricotta, a spoonful of sauce, and a sprinkle of mozzarella/Parmesan. Add meat if using.
4. **Second Layer:** Place a second wonton wrapper on top, pressing down slightly. Repeat the layers: ricotta, sauce, and cheeses.
5. **Top:** Finish with a generous amount of mozzarella on top of each cup.
6. **Bake:** Bake for 18-20 minutes until the edges of the wontons are golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and browned.

## Muffin-Specific Pro Tips
- **Corner Watch:** The corners of the wonton wrappers can brown quickly. If they look too dark before the cheese is melted, tent the pan loosely with foil.
- **The "Pop" Out:** Let them cool for 2-3 minutes; they should pop out easily with the help of a butter knife.
