# Mini Meatloaf Bites

[Jump to Recipe](#recipe-card)

## Why Muffin Pans?
A full-sized meatloaf often suffers from an uneven cook or a soggy middle. The muffin pan ensures every "bite" has a perfectly caramelized exterior glaze and a juicy interior. Plus, they cook in just 20 minutes instead of an hour.

## Ingredients
### The Loaf Mixture
- 680g (1.5 lbs) Lean ground beef (90/10)
- 50g (1/2 cup) Panko breadcrumbs
- 1 large Egg
- 60ml (1/4 cup) Milk
- 15ml (1 tbsp) Worcestershire sauce
- 5g (1 tsp) Garlic powder
- 5g (1 tsp) Onion powder
- 4g (1 tsp) Salt

### The Glaze
- 120ml (1/2 cup) Ketchup
- 15ml (1 tbsp) Brown sugar
- 5ml (1 tsp) Yellow mustard

## Instructions
1. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 12-cup standard muffin pan.
2. **Mix Loaf:** In a large bowl, combine beef, breadcrumbs, egg, milk, Worcestershire sauce, and spices. Mix gently by hand until just combined—don't overwork the meat.
3. **Portion:** Scoop the meat mixture into the muffin cups, smoothing the tops.
4. **Glaze:** Whisk the glaze ingredients together and spread a tablespoon over each meatloaf.
5. **Bake:** Bake for 20-22 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C).
6. **Rest:** Allow the meatloaves to rest in the pan for 5 minutes. This helps the juices redistribute so they don't fall apart.

## Muffin-Specific Pro Tips
- **Drain the Fat:** If using higher-fat meat, you may see some liquid at the bottom of the cups. Use a spoon or paper towel to carefully dab it away before serving.
- **Vegetable Hack:** Finely grate a carrot or zucchini into the mix to add moisture and hidden nutrients without affecting the structural integrity of the mini loaf.
