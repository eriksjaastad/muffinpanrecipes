# Muffin Pan Recipes: Image Style Guide

This document defines the visual identity for all food photography on MuffinPanRecipes.com. To maintain an "Editorial Cookbook" aesthetic, every image must follow these strict guidelines.

## 🎨 The Aesthetic: "Clean Kitchen Editorial"
The goal is to evoke a sense of high-end, minimalist cookery. Images should feel bright, organic, and professional.

## 💡 Lighting: High-Key & Natural
- **Source:** Simulated natural daylight coming from the side (9 o'clock or 3 o'clock position).
- **Quality:** Soft, diffused light.
- **Shadows:** Soft and subtle. No harsh, dark shadows.
- **Exposure:** High-key (bright and airy), but with preserved highlights.

## 🖼️ Composition & Background
- **Surface:** White marble countertop or very light, neutral-toned stone.
- **Props:** Served in a rustic, slightly weathered muffin tin. Minimal extra props (maybe a sprig of fresh herb or a dusting of flour if appropriate).
- **Angle:** 45-degree angle or low-profile side view to emphasize the height and texture of the "muffin."
- **Focus:** Macro-level detail on the top texture of the food.
- **Structural Emphasis:** For "Vessel within Vessel" recipes (e.g., Bacon Baskets), use a side-profile or "Cross-Section" view to showcase the architecture and layering of the food.

## 📷 Camera Settings (Simulated)
- **Lens:** 85mm macro lens.
- **Aperture:** f/2.8 (shallow depth of field, creamy background blur).
- **Clarity:** Sharp focus on the subject with soft fall-off.

## 🚫 Negative Constraints (What to Avoid)
- **No People:** No hands, faces, or figures.
- **No Text:** No watermarks or overlaid text.
- **No Clutter:** Avoid busy backgrounds or colorful napkins.
- **No Dark Mode:** No "moody" or dark/low-key lighting.
