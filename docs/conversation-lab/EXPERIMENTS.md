# Conversation Lab - Experiment Log

Card #6492. This file is the versioned, in-repo record of the manual
conversation self-learning loop. It replaces
`~/.claude/projects/-Users-eriksjaastad-projects-muffinpanrecipes/memory/project_conversation_tuning_log.md`
as the canonical history - that memory file is machine-local and not
reviewable in a PR; this one is. See `PROTOCOL.md` in this directory for the
method these entries follow.

## Weekly rubric history

One row per week read at a check-in (see PROTOCOL.md's "Weekly ritual").
Columns:

- **Week** - episode id and dish name.
- **Tit** - Title fidelity: does the dish stay about its named hero
ingredient?
- **Arc** - Arc resolution: do raised problems actually get resolved, not
reframed away?
- **Voice** - Voice distinctiveness: are the characters separable blind?
- **Tech** - Technical credibility: would a real cook believe the
food-science?
- **Prog** - Natural progression: builds vs. repeats/agrees-in-circles?
- **P/D** - Promise/delivery alignment: does the dialogue promise what the
recipe or images will not deliver?

Each score is 1-5. A `*` on a score means the read was partial (not all
days existed yet at read time). **promptV** is the character-prompt version
in effect for that read (see "Prompt versions" below) - this is what makes a
score comparable across weeks.

| Week | Tit | Arc | Voice | Tech | Prog | P/D | promptV | Notes |
|------|-----|-----|-------|------|------|-----|---------|-------|
| W32 (Miso Ginger Salmon Cups) | 2 | 2* | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | v1 | Baseline. Salmon vanished into a rice essay (title fidelity). Tuesday's "rice sticking" problem got reframed as a story beat, never solved (arc). Voices strong. Baked sushi rice is culinarily shaky (tech). *Arc partial - only Mon/Tue existed at read time. |
| W36 (Greek Spanakopita Cups) - BEFORE | 4 | 3* | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | v1 | Prompt leak: Margaret's first line recited the `_SHARED_RULES` example sentence verbatim. "Crispy when it cools" is wrong for phyllo. Marcus took two near-identical turns. "X is actually the story" appeared 3x. |
| W36 (Greek Spanakopita Cups) - AFTER | 4 | 4* | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | v2 | Regenerated Mon+Tue via the production call path; Opus judge PASS both days. Real disagreement was reached and resolved. Still only 4 of 7 characters present; Marcus's tic persists. |

## Prompt versions

- **v1** - as of 2026-08-06. Baseline. The `_SHARED_RULES` example included a
literal pan-case demonstration sentence that character prompts would
sometimes recite verbatim instead of using as a template (see W36 BEFORE).
- **v2** - 2026-09-02. Removed the literal pan-case example sentence from
`_SHARED_RULES` and replaced it with constraints instead of a worked
example (name a mechanism specific to THIS dish; never a bare conclusion;
never open a stage with it).
- **v3** - 2026-09-05 (#6832 roster fix: Julian added to Monday's cast,
Devon added to Tuesday's, matching what `CHARACTER_DAY_GOALS` already
assumed; #6840 turn-taking rule, verbatim: "Your first sentence must
respond to what was just said. Don't change the subject. A turn can be
one sentence, a single question, or a direct answer to the last speaker -
that is a complete turn, not a shortfall. If the last message asked you
something, answer it before you add anything new." plus prompt-echo
detection extended to any 6+-word run shared with the shared rules text;
#6861 structured 8-dimension judge). First live week: **W37,
Monday 2026-09-07.**

## Experiments

Empty except this header - `scripts/conversation_lab.py` appends a row here
each time an offline A/B experiment completes (see PROTOCOL.md's
"Experiment steps"). Do not hand-edit rows into this table; let the tool
write them so the log and the tool never drift apart.

| Date | Experiment ID | Lever (one) | Target dimension(s) | N | Wins/Ties/Losses on target | Other dimensions lost | Decision | Shipped PR | Live confirmation week + scores |
